# CS 212, hw1-2: Jokers Wild
#
# -----------------
# User Instructions
#
# Write a function best_wild_hand(hand) that takes as
# input a 7-card hand and returns the best 5 card hand.
# In this problem, it is possible for a hand to include
# jokers. Jokers will be treated as 'wild cards' which
# can take any rank or suit of the same color. The 
# black joker, '?B', can be used as any spade or club
# and the red joker, '?R', can be used as any heart 
# or diamond.
#
# The itertools library may be helpful. Feel free to 
# define multiple functions if it helps you solve the
# problem. 
#
# -----------------
# Grading Notes
# 
# Muliple correct answers will be accepted in cases 
# where the best hand is ambiguous (for example, if 
# you have 4 kings and 3 queens, there are three best
# hands: 4 kings along with any of the three queens).
